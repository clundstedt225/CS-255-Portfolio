# CS-255-Portfolio
SNHU CS-255

- For this project our client "DriverPass" wanted to provide online training for their students who were learning how to drive. To do this, they wanted me to design a cloud based web solution that would work on most devices from desktop to mobile.

- One thing I did particularly well in this process was to clearly outline the objectives/goals and how the cross platform aspect should be handled to minimize the users confusion.

- If I could pick one part of these documents to revise, it would be the initial UML use case diagram and add some missing details such as use cases to it.

- When interpreting the users needs and implementing them into the system design, I thought about keeping it consistent with other online learning platforms and sign-in processes so as to not re-invent the wheel. It's important to consider the users needs when designing so as to limit and reduce unnecessary confusion that could have been solved with better system design principles.

- When approaching designing software, I first consider the tools and languages required to best complete the project since a web based soluition can have different needs than a standalone program. In the future I would use the collection of requirements from the client as they see it to best understand what kind of solution would work best to meet their needs, web based or otherwise.
